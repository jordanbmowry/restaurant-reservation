# Restaurant Reservation

## Live Demo

[Restaurant Reservation](https://reservation-front-end.herokuapp.com/)

This is a full stack capstone project for [Thinkful's software engineering bootcamp](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/). The following scenario was given as a prompt:

> You have been hired as a full stack developer at a startup that is creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants.
> The software is used only by restaurant personnel - at this point, the customers will not access the system online.

## User Stories

The application was developed following the user stories supplied by a figurative manager, using a test driven development process. Users (restaurant employees) of this application can currently:

- ### US-01 Create and list reservations and tables
  As a restaurant manager
  I want to create a new reservation when a customer calls
  so that I know how many customers will arrive at the restaurant on a given day.

Dashboard does not display tables if no tables are in the database or if there are no reservations created for the date on dashboard.

Creating a new reservation "John Doe".
![Create reservation John Doe](readme-screenshots/createdReservation1.png)
Creating a new reservation "Jane Doe".
![Created reservation Jane Doe](readme-screenshots/createdReservation2.png)
Creating a new table "Bar #1" with capacity of 1.
![Create new table 1](readme-screenshots/createNewTable.png)
Dashboard displaying new table "Bar #1".
![Created new table 1](readme-screenshots/createdNewTable.png)
Creating a new table "Banquet Room" with capacity of 10.
![Create new table 2](readme-screenshots/createNewTable2.png)
Dashboard displaying the two new reservations and two new tables.

- ### US-02 Create reservation on a future, working date

  As a restaurant manager
  I only want to allow reservations to be created on a day when we are open
  so that users do not accidentally create a reservation for days when we are closed.

  Backend responding with error message for new reservation for 1:30 AM ðŸ¥±.
  ![Bad reservation 1](readme-screenshots/badReservation1.png)
  Backend responding with error message for new reservation on Tuesday (restaurant closed on Tuesdays).
  ![Bad reservation 2](readme-screenshots/badReservation2.png)
  Backend responding with error message for new reservation in the past date.
  ![Bad reservation 3](readme-screenshots/badReservation3.png)

- ### US-03 Create reservation within eligible timeframe
  As a restaurant manager
  I only want to allow reservations to be created during business hours, up to 60 minutes before closing
  so that users do not accidentally create a reservation for a time we cannot accommodate.

Backend responding with error message for new reservation for 9:35 PM (restaurant closes at 10:30 PM).

- ### US-04 Seat reservation
  As a restaurant manager,
  When a customer with an existing reservation arrives at the restaurant
  I want to seat (assign) their reservation to a specific table
  so that I know which tables are occupied and free.

Seating "John Doe" to a table.
![Seat reservation](readme-screenshots/seatReservation.png)
Dashboard displaying John Doe as seated and Bar #1 as occupied

- ### US-05 Finish an occupied table

  As a restaurant manager
  I want to free up an occupied table when the guests leave
  so that I can seat new guests at that table.

  Clicking red "Finish" button on table requires confirmation in the browser.
  ![Confirm finish Table](readme-screenshots/confirmFinishReservation.png)
  Dashboard displaying Bar #1 as being free and "John Doe" disappeared from view.
  ![Finished Table](readme-screenshots/finishedReservation.png)

- ### US-06 Reservation Status

  As a restaurant manager
  I want a reservation to have a status of either booked, seated, or finished
  so that I can see which reservation parties are seated, and finished reservations are hidden from the dashboard

- ### US-07 Search for a reservation by phone number

  As a restaurant manager
  I want to search for a reservation by phone number (partial or complete)
  so that I can quickly access a customer's reservation when they call about their reservation.

  "John Doe" reservation displays when number correct number is searched.
  ![Searched reservation](readme-screenshots/searchedReservation1.png)

- ### US-08 Change an existing reservation

  As a restaurant manager
  I want to be able to modify a reservation if a customer calls to change or cancel their reservation
  so that reservations are accurate and current.

  Reservations with status : "booked" are able to be changed
  ![Edit reservation](readme-screenshots/editReservation.png)
  "Jane Doe" changed reservation time and party number.
  ![Changed reservation](readme-screenshots/editedReservation.png)
  "Jane Doe" cancelling reservation.
  ![Confirm cancel reservation](readme-screenshots/confirmCancel.png)
  Cancelled reservations are no longer displayed on dashboard.
  ![Confirm cancel reservation](readme-screenshots/canceledReservation.png)
  Cancelled reservation can still be displayed when searched.
